## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

OmniRamp redefines fiat-to-crypto transition through a secure, decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) onramp/offramp trading protocol. Combining on-chain governance, cross-chain interoperability and privacy-first infrastructure to create a non-custodial marketplace that eliminates reliance on centralized exchanges (CEXs), empowering users trade fiat and crypto assets directly.

Leveraging Polkadot, OmniRamp bolsters Web3 adoption, bridging traditional finance and decentralized ecosystems while prioritizing security, accessibility, and user sovereignty.

#### Core Value Proposition

1. *Decentralized P2P Marketplace*

    - Non-Custodial Trading.

    - Assets are secured via a multi-signature(signatures between buyer and seller) escrow pallet, removing third-party custody risks.

    - Initial support for DOT/USD & USDT/USD transitions, with ongoing research for other pairs.

2. *Cross-Chain Liquidity Engine*

    - Polkadot Native: Leverages XCM for seamless asset transfers across parachains (e.g., initially DOT and USDT on AssetHub).

    - Future cross-chain Integration: Utilizing trustless bridging infrastructure (Hyperbridge, Snowfork) to enable cross-chain p2p transition across other Blockchain networks such as BNB, Ethereum e.t.c.

3. *Privacy-First Compliance*

    - Zero-KYC Model: On-chain reputation scoring replaces centralized identity checks, prioritizing user privacy.

    - Privacy preserving chat platform.

4. *Dispute Resolution Framework*

    - DAO Arbitration: Decentralized collective of staked arbitrators to resolve conflicts, with penalties for malicious rulings.

    - Auto-Refund Mechanisms: Funds returned automatically if disputes remain unresolved after some configured duration.

### Team Motivation

The team envisions OmniRamp as a clear delineation between permissionless systems and blockchain cartel-like operations, such as centralized exchanges (CEXs)

#### Personal Pain Point

CEX hacks has underscored the urgent need for permissionless systems to become the default user onramp/offramp for crypto adoption. Centralized platforms, while convenient, remain vulnerable to security breaches, regulatory risks, and operational failures. This incident highlights the inherent risks of entrusting assets to intermediaries, reinforcing the necessity of decentralized alternatives that empower users with full control over their funds and access to financial services without reliance on centralized entities.

#### Decentralized Systems Advocates and Implementors

Our team brings years  of combined experience in:

  - Substrate Development: Core contributors to Polkadot Parachains since 2021 and current Polkadot fellowship members.

  - Interoperability: Background in building cross-chain protocols(i.e. [Hyperbridge](https://github.com/polytope-labs/hyperbridge/graphs/contributors)).

  - Governance: Architected DAOs(i.e. [Secretary Program](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/347) for the polkadot fellowship).


#### What Excites us Technically

  - Trustless Interop Transitions: Enabling cross-chain escrow without wrapped assets or bridge risks.

  - Reputation Pallet: Building sybil-resistant scoring purely on-chain.

  - LibP2P Integration: Decentralizing communication layer.


## Project Details

### Protocol Overview
OmniRamp’s protocol enables seamless, decentralized fiat-crypto transitions through a four-step process:

#### Offer Creation

- Token Selection: Buyers list supported pairs(e.g., DOT/USD)..

- Pricing: Set exchange rates (e.g., 1 DOT = $7 USD) and choose fiat payment methods (bank transfer, PayPal e.t.c.).

#### User Engagement

- Order Matching: User filter offers by action (Buy/Sell), pairs, price, and merchant reputation (1–5 stars).

- Escrow Initialization: Accepted Offers are secured via OmniRamp’s multi-sig escrow pallet, ensuring merchant cannot withdraw once a user initiates a transaction.

#### Settlement

- Off-Chain Payment: Buyer (User or merchant) sends fiat via recipient’s preferred method (e.g., wire transfer, bank transfer, PayPal).

- Proof Submission: Buyer (User or merchant) uploads encrypted payment proof (e.g., IPFS hash of the payment reciept) using the communication protocol.

#### Asset Release or Dispute

- Auto-Release: User / Merchant confirms payment within configured duration → escrow releases crypto to User / Merchant.

- Dispute Trigger: If unresolved, escrow locks funds and buyer/seller initiates arbitration.


### Escrow Model: Secure, Time-Bound Custody

OmniRamp’s escrow system ensures fairness and eliminates counterparty risk:

#### Multi-Chain Escrow Pallets

- Built on Substrate, escrow pallet initially support assets from Polkadot parachains (via XCM) with support for external chains (via bridges) in the near future.

- Funds are held in 2-of-3 multi-sig accounts, requiring buyer and seller and/or arbitrator consensus for release.

#### Arbitration Mechanism

- DAO Governance: Staked $RAMP holders vote on disputes, with votes weighted by stake size.

- Slashing: Arbitrators acting maliciously lose some of their stake.

- Auto-Refund: If seller doesn’t confirm/reject payment within the specified on-chain time limit, a dispute case is issued.

#### Fraud Prevention

1. Reputation Penalties

    - **Tiered Penalties**

        - First offense (unresponsiveness*): Reputation loss base.

        - Repeat offenses: Penalty increases per incident (e.g., 15% on second offense).

        - After 3 offenses: Temporary suspension and mandatory resolution training.

    - **Appeal Process**: Allow sellers to contest penalties with evidence (e.g., technical issues).

    - **Recovery Path**: Regain lost reputation through successful transactions (e.g., +5% per 5 completed orders).

2. Sybil Resistance

    - **Gradual Trust Building**: New Users: Start with low trade limits (e.g., $100 limit) until reputation is establised.

    - **Reputation Tiers**: limits change based on

        - Transaction history (e.g., 10+ successful trades unlocks $1,000 limit).

        - Community endorsements (e.g., reviews from trusted users).

        - Reputation penalties: Sellers lose a percentage (e.g., 20%) of their score for unresponsive behavior.

3. Malicious Behavior Detection

    - Contextual Reputation Deductions:

        - Minor failures (e.g., payment timeout): reputation decrease.

        - Repeat failures: reputation decrease + initiate abitrator review for intent.

        - Proven fraud: Account blacklisted.

    - Fraud Triggers:

        - Auto-flag users with high cancellation rates or disputed orders.

        - Investigate patterns (e.g., users who initiate only high-value trades).

4. Positive Reinforcement

    - Reward good actors with:

        - Reputation boosts for consistent on-time completions.

        - Badges or perks (e.g., "Trusted Seller" status, reduced platform fees).

Benefits:

1. Funds remain on native chains via XCM, eliminating bridge risks while enabling multi-chain trading. Users retain custody without exposure to wrapped asset vulnerabilities.

2. 2-of-3 multi-sig escrow prevents unilateral fund access, while stake-weighted DAO arbitration aligns incentives for honest outcomes. Slashing disincentivizes malicious arbitrators.

3. Auto-refunds + reputation penalties create economic costs for bad actors. Sybil-resistant limits for new users reduce spam, while responsive sellers gain higher trade caps over time.


#### Cross-Chain Token Support (XCM)

*Unified Asset Availability*

- Merchants list tokens from supported chains (e.g., DOT from Relay Chain).

- Buyers purchase assets natively without wrapping (e.g., trade DOT for USDT on AssetHub directly via XCM).


*XCM Workflow*

(Lock-and-Transfer)When a buyer selects a cross-chain asset (e.g., USDT on AssetHub), OmniRamp:

- Locks USDT via escrow pallet's unified address on the source chain.

- Post-trade, unlocking the original asset and send to reciepient on the source chain.


Benefits:

1. No Bridge Risk: Avoids centralized bridging solutions prone to exploits.

2. Atomic Swaps: XCM ensures trades either complete fully or revert, eliminating partial failures.

### Ecosystem Fit

Where does OmniRamp fit?

OmniRamp fills Polkadot’s critical gap in decentralized fiat access, serving as the missing bridge between traditional finance and multi-chain DeFi. Unlike CEX-centric solutions, it leverages:

- Polkadot’s shared security.

- XCM for cross-chain dispursment of assets.

##### Target Audience

- End Users: Crypto newcomers needing low-friction fiat onboarding.

- Parachains: Teams seeking fiat onramp liquidity bootstraping.

- DEXs: Integrate fiat ramps via OmniRamp’s API (e.g., HydraDX).

##### Competitive Landscape

- Polkadot Ecosystem: No direct competitors; existing bridges lack fiat pairs.

- External Ecosystems: Bisq (Bitcoin-only) e.t.c.
